# This project!
This is a demo of how to get values out of text boxes using React - and put those values somewhere else on the page. We will not be using getElementById.

# Want to run this?
1. clone it
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run`

# notes
* npm vs yarn? They do the same thing. Pick one per project. Which one you pick is an 'architect' decision.
* React concepts:
  * components
    * props
  * state
* plan:
  * display a piece of state as the contents of the h1
  * when the textbox changes, change that piece of state
